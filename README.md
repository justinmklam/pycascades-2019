# PyCascades 2019

Conference notes from [PyCascades 2019](https://2019.pycascades.com/) in Seattle, WA.

- [Day 2 - Sunday, February 24](day-2-notes.md)

**Main Takeaways:** 

- A few good talks, but the rest were okay. Could have gotten most info from Googling about the topic. 
- Best talks involved providing insight that you couldn't get from an online tutorial, ie:
  - Katie McLaughlin: Turning 'wat' into 'why'
  - Ben Berry: Who to blame for all your problems
  - Dustin Ingram: Data Protection for Developers: Past, Present, and Future
- A number of presentations were targeted to more of a beginner audience, which was unfortunate. Presenters should assume that most attendees are fluent in Python.
- Would probably not go again (but would be interested in PyCon in New York, ie. the currently largest Python conference).
- Good t-shirt swag from sponsors though!
